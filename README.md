docker-webex
============

Run [Cisco WebEx][1] inside docker.

To use it simply clone this repository and run the `webex.sh` script.<br/>

This will build the image and execute firefox in the resulting container
ready to go to the WebEx site.

Status
------

* Use xauth and updated Firefox from Vivid
* Audio and various sharing options work.
* Webcam video is limited to view-only. This is a limitation on the
  Linux client.
